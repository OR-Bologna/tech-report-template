# Technical Report template

This is the LaTeX template used for technical reports of the Operational Research group at the University of Bologna.

## Usage

You can use it as any other LaTeX files. Normally a pass of `pdflatex report.tex`, plus one of `bibtex report` if citations have changed, and two more of `pdflatex` to fix citations in place should be more than enough.
